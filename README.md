# Warno Realism Mod

A mod focused entirely on the idea of realism first, balance second.

The current focus is to make the stats of all units as realistic as possible.

Possible future ideas:
- Modify distance scaling system to make map distances 1:1
- Modify battlegroup decks to ensure available units are historically accurate
- Modify forest mechanics to heavily dissuade moving armor through all but the thinnest of treelines
